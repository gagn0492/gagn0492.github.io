			<p> About Rupert: Rupert is one of my sister's dogs. He is a rescue dog and a Beagle-Boxer mix. He not the smartest, and gets confused sometimes but is really sweet and loves to cuddle. Rupert will meet you for the first time and think that you are his best friend. Rupert loves food and will often do checks to make sure his brother Watson has finished all of his. Rupert also loves naps, and often spends his afternoons doing so. Unlike his brother Watson, Rupert does not enjoy wearing sweaters. </p>
