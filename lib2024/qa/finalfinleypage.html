			<p> About Finley: Finley is my pet dog and she is an Aussie Doodle. Finley loves to cuddle and thinks she's a lap dog despite being 50 pounds. Despite her size, she is scared of almost everything. She is very smart and can do tricks like jumping through hoops, jumping on logs, and finding people who are hiding. One thing that she has not mastered is how to get through a door that is partially open. She will do anything for food. Even if it goes against morals.</p>
