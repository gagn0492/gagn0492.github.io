			<p> Date of Birth: April 2019</p>
			<p> About Watson: Watson is one of my sistet's pet dogs and is Cocker Spaniel Poodle Mix. He is very smart, almost too smart and often thinks he is more human than dog. He do tricks like jumping through hoops, throwing basketballs into hoops (not joking he can really do this!), spinning and high fives. Watson actually loves to wear sweaters and has a large collection. His favourite toy is a stuffed lamb. He loves his owners, and tolerates my sister's other dog Rupert. </p>
